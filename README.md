**ARRANGE** is a small sized console based number arranging game. You need to arrange number in a 2D format. Like

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
Once you run `Main.main` you will be asked to select the hardness level. You may either enter

1. `easy`
2. `moderate` or `medium`
3. `hard`
4. `n` for a `n by n` game.
5. `m n` for a `m by n` game.

ARRANGE also understands natural language (somewhat and faked). You may enter `I want to play a easy game` or `Lets play a 100 by 200 game`.
Once the game start you need to enter a number and the direction to move the number (two number will swap). Like

    1 u
    //To swap 1 with the number above (if available)
Available options are

1. `u` for UP
2. `d` for DOWN
3. `l` for LEFT
4. `r` for RIGHT

Again you may enter `Move 20 towards lEfT`.
Enter `e` or `exit` anytime to exit from the game. Once you finish a game you can play again, enter `YES` or `NO`.
